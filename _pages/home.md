### Welcome

My research focuses on developing and evaluating personalized, adaptive delivery systems for supplementary learning materials to support diverse student knowledge levels and preferences in Software Engineering Education, a method termed the AI-driven Adaptive Learning Platform.

#### Research focus
- Continuously assess student knowledge states and learning preferences.
- Select and adapt content (readings, videos, exercises) to maximize engagement and mastery.
- Provide timely feedback and scaffolding for underrepresented and novice learners.
- Integrate with software engineering curricula and tooling to measure real learning outcomes.

This work brings together machine learning, human–computer interaction, and education research to create equitable, data‑driven learning experiences that improve retention, confidence, and performance in software engineering courses.
